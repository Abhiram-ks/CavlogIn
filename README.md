Cavlog Admin Panel

- Project Overview
Cavlog is a smart barber booking platform, and this Admin Panel is the central control system that empowers the administrator to manage, monitor, and maintain the entire ecosystem effectively. The admin can validate barbers, approve or reject their registration, and dynamically manage available servicesâ€”ensuring no duplicate services under different names. The system also allows the admin to add promotional banners that can be displayed on both the client and barber apps, enhancing user engagement.
Additionally, the admin can track platform-wide activities, view booking histories in detail (who booked, when, where, and how), and monitor wallet transactions across users and barbers. The panel supports service blocking/unblocking and document verification features, ensuring trust and quality within the platform. With real-time data handling and a clean, modular structure, this panel acts as the backbone of the Cavlog ecosystem.
